            Rationale: 'Increased risk of GI bleeding compared with warfarin (based on head-to-head clinical trials) and of GI bleeding and major bleeding compared with apixaban (based on observational studies and meta-analyses) in older adults when used for long-term treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or VTE.',
            Recommendation: 'Use caution in selecting dabigatran over other DOACs (e.g., apixaban) for long term treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or VTE.\nSee also criteria on warfarin and rivaroxaban (Table 2) and footnoted regarding choice among DOACs.',

            Recommendation: 'Use with caution, particularly in adults 75 years old and older.\nIf prasugrel is used, consider a lower dose (5 mg) for those 75 years old and older.',
