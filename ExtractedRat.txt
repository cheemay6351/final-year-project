Highly anticholinergic; clearance reduced with advanced age, and tolerance develops when used as hypnotic; risk of confusion, dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic effects or toxicity
Use of diphenhydramine in situations such as acute treatment of severe allergic reaction may be appropriate.
Not recommended for prevention or treatment of extrapyramidal symptoms with antipsychotics; more effective agents available for treatment of Parkinson disease
Highly anticholinergic, uncertain effectiveness
May cause orthostatic hypotension; more effective alternatives available; IV form acceptable for use in cardiac stress testing
Potential for pulmonary toxicity, hepatoxicity, and peripheral neuropathy, especially with long-term use; safer alternatives available
High risk of orthostatic hypotension and associated harms, especially in older adults; not recommended as routine treatment for hypertension; alternative agents have superior risk/beneﬁt proﬁle

High risk of adverse CNS effects; may cause bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension; not recommended as routine treatment for hypertension
May induce heart failure in older adults because of potent negative inotropic action; strongly anticholinergic; other antiarrhythmic drugs preferred
Worse outcomes have been reported in patients taking dronedarone who have permanent atrial ﬁbrillation or severe or recently decompensated heart failure.
Use in atrial ﬁbrillation: should not be used as ﬁrst-line agent in atrial ﬁbrillation, because there are safer and more effective alternatives for rate control supported by high-quality evidence.
Use in heart failure: evidence for beneﬁts and harms of digoxin is conﬂicting and of lower quality; most but not all of the evidence concerns use in HFrEF. There is strong evidence for other agents as ﬁrst-line therapy to reduce hospitalizations and mortality in adults with HFrEF. In heart failure, higher dosages are not associated with additional beneﬁt and may increase risk of toxicity.
Decreased renal clearance of digoxin may lead to increased risk of toxic effects; further dose reduction may be necessary in those with stage or chronic kidney disease.
Potential for hypotension; risk of precipitating myocardial ischemia
Effective for maintaining sinus rhythm but has greater toxicities than other antiarrhythmics used in atrial ﬁbrillation; may be reasonable ﬁrst-line therapy in patients with concomitant heart failure or substantial left ventricular hypertrophy if rhythm control is preferred over rate control
Highly anticholinergic, sedating, and cause orthostatic hypotension; safety proﬁle of low-dose doxepin (≤6 mg/day) comparable to that of placebo
Increased risk of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and greater rate of cognitive decline and mortality in persons with dementia
Avoid antipsychotics for behavioral problems of dementia or delirium unless nonpharmacological options (eg, behavioral interventions) have failed or are not possible and the older adult is threatening substantial harm to self or others
High rate of physical dependence, tolerance to sleep beneﬁts, greater risk of overdose at low dosages
Older adults have increased sensitivity to benzodiazepines and decreased metabolism of long- acting agents; in general, all benzodiazepines increase risk of cognitive impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, and motor vehicle crashes in older adults
May be appropriate for seizure disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, benzodiazepine withdrawal, ethanol withdrawal, severe generalized anxiety disorder, and periprocedural anesthesia
High rate of physical dependence; sedating
Nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (ie, drugs) have adverse events similar to those of benzodiazepines in older adults (eg, delirium, falls, fractures); increased emergency room visits/ hospitalizations; motor vehicle crashes; minimal improvement in sleep latency and duration
Lack of efﬁcacy
Potential for cardiac problems; contraindicated in men with prostate cancer
Concerns about cardiac effects; safer alternatives available
Evidence of carcinogenic potential (breast and endometrium); lack of cardioprotective effect and cognitive protection in older women
Evidence indicates that vaginal estrogens for the treatmen of vaginal dryness are safe and effective; women with history of breast cancer who do not respond to nonhormonal therapies are advised to discuss the risks and beneﬁts of low-dose vaginal estrogen (dosages of estradiol <25 μg twice weekly) with their healthcare provider
Impact on body composition is small and associated with edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome, gynecomastia, impaired fasting glucose
Evidence of carcinogenic potential (breast and endometrium); lack of cardioprotective effect and cognitive protection in older women
Evidence indicates that vaginal estrogens for the treatmen of vaginal dryness are safe and effective; women with history of breast cancer who do not respond to nonhormonal therapies are advised to discuss the risks and beneﬁts of low-dose vaginal estrogen (dosages of estradiol <25 μg twice weekly) with their healthcare provider
Minimal effect on weight; increases risk of thrombotic events and possibly death in older adults
Chlorpropamide: prolonged half-life in older adults; can cause prolonged hypoglycemia; causes SIADH
Glimepiride and glyburide: higher risk of severe prolonged hypoglycemia in older adults
Can cause extrapyramidal effects, including tardive dyskinesia; risk may be greater in frail older adults and with prolonged exposure
Potential for aspiration and adverse effects; safer alternatives available
Risk of Clostridium difﬁcile infection and bone loss and fractures
Oral analgesic not effective in dosages commonly used; may have higher risk of neurotoxicity, including delirium, than other opioids; safer alternatives available
Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding or peptic ulcer disease in high-risk groups, including those >75 years or taking oral or parenteral corticosteroids, anticoagulants, or antiplatelet agents; use of proton-pump inhibitor or misoprostol reduces but does not eliminate risk. Upper gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation caused by NSAIDs occur in ~1% of patients treated for
3-6 months and in ~2%-4% of patients treated for year; these trends continue with longer duration of use. Also can increase blood pressure and induce kidney injury. 
Risks are dose related.
Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding/peptic ulcer disease and acute kidney injury in older adults
Indomethacin is more likely than other NSAIDs to have adverse CNS effects. Of all the NSAIDs, indomethacin has the most adverse effects.
Most muscle relaxants poorly tolerated by older adults because some have anticholinergic adverse effects, sedation, increased risk of fractures; effectiveness at dosages tolerated by older adults questionable
High risk of hyponatremia; safer alternative treatments
