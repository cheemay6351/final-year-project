INTRODUCTION

The Beers Criteria was developed by the late Mark Beers,
MD, and colleagues at the University of California Los
Angeles in 1991, with the purpose of identifying medica-
tions for which potential harm outweighed the expected
benefit and that should be avoided in nursing home

the criteria to apply to all older adults.2 The criteria was
updated by an interprofessional group in 2003 and the

intent of the original Beers Criteria by providing an
explicit list of PIMs that are best avoided by older adults
in most circumstances or under specific situations, such
as certain diseases, conditions, or care settings.

The AGS Beers Criteria

comprises drugs and drug
classes that the AGS and its expert panel consider to be
potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) for use in
older adults. The expert panel organized the criteria into
the same five general categories that were used in the
2019 update:

®

1. Medications considered as potentially inappropriate

(Table 2);

2. Medications potentially inappropriate in patients with

certain diseases or syndromes (Table 3);

3. Medications to be used with caution (Table 4);
4. Potentially

inappropriate

drug–drug

interactions

(Table 5); and

5. Medications whose dosages should be adjusted based

on renal function (Table 6).

Using the five categories of criteria as a framework, an
interprofessional expert panel reviewed new data pub-
lished since the 2019 update (beginning in 2017, the cutoff
date for the prior update's literature review) to identify evi-
dence that would remove, sustain, or alter existing criteria
recommendations, rationale, level of evidence, or strength
of recommendations. The panel also considered evidence
that would support the addition of new criteria. For the
first time, the panel systematically considered usage in the
United States to determine whether any medications (and
resulting criteria) should be removed because of very low
or absent usage in the United States. Finally, the panel
aimed to enhance usability by consolidating the formatting
of the criteria for clarity and space.

OBJECTIVES

®

The specific aim was to update the 2019 AGS Beers
using a comprehensive, systematic review and
Criteria
grading of the evidence on drug-related problems and
adverse events in older adults. The strategies to achieve
this aim were to:

• Convene an interprofessional panel of 12 experts in
geriatric care and pharmacotherapy and three ex-
officio representatives from key stakeholder groups
who would:
(cid:1) Review evidence published between 2017 and 2022

,
and use this to update the 2019 AGS Beers Criteria
with consideration to removing or modifying exist-
ing criteria and adding new criteria.

Key points

®

• The intention of the AGS Beers Criteria

is to:
(1) reduce older adults' exposure to potentially
inappropriate medications (PIMs) by improv-
ing medication selection; (2) educate clinicians
and patients; and (3) serve as a tool for evaluat-
ing the quality of care, cost, and patterns of
drug use in older adults.

®

• The target audience for the 2023 AGS Beers
is practicing clinicians and others

who utilize the criteria including healthcare
researchers, pharmacy benefits
consumers,
managers, regulators, and policymakers.

• The criteria are intended to be applied to adults
65 years old and older in all ambulatory, acute,
and institutionalized settings of care, except
hospice and end-of-life care settings.

care, cost, and patterns of drug use in older adults. Others
who utilize the criteria include healthcare consumers,
researchers, pharmacy benefits managers, regulators, and
policymakers. As with previous updates, the panel had
discussions and debates in an effort to attain a balance
between the multiple uses and users. We note that the
criteria are a blunt instrument and that we are unable to
delineate all specialized use cases and possible exceptions
to the criteria.

®

The AGS and the panel remind users of the AGS Beers
that the criteria are not to be used in a punitive
Criteria
manner. Prescribing for older adults is often a complex
endeavor involving the consideration of many factors, par-
ticularly the preferences and goals of the older person and
their family. Deprescribing studies have demonstrated how
critical patient and family input and buy-in can be to the
success of discontinuing medications responsible for actual
or potential harm or that provide little to no therapeutic
value.3 Quality measures must be clearly defined, easily
applied, and measured with limited information and, thus,
although useful, cannot perfectly distinguish appropriate
from inappropriate care. The panel's review of evidence at
times identified subgroups of individuals who should be
exempt from a given criterion or to whom a specific crite-
rion should apply. Such a criterion may not be easily
applied as a quality measure, particularly when such sub-
groups cannot be easily identified through structured and
readily accessible electronic data (e.g., when diagnoses, the
purpose of prescribing, or laboratory measures such as kid-
ney function are not available).

including the rigor of the evidence review and synthesis
process.4 These methods were adapted from the Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines for clinical practice
guideline development and are consistent with recom-
mendations from the National Academy of Medicine.5,6

Panel composition

®

The AGS Beers Criteria
expert panel included 12 inter-
professional members drawn from medicine, nursing,
and pharmacy, 10 of whom had participated in the 2019
update. Panelists had experience in different practice set-
tings, including ambulatory care, home care, acute hos-
pital care, skilled nursing facilities, and long-term care.
In addition, the panel included ex-officio representa-
tives from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Ser-
vices, the National Committee for Quality Assurance,
and the Pharmacy Quality Alliance. Potential conflicts
of interest were disclosed at the beginning of the pro-
cess and before each full panel call and are listed in the
disclosures section of this paper. Panelists were recused
from discussion in areas in which they had a potential
conflict of interest.

Literature review

Literature searches were conducted in PubMed from
June 1, 2017, to May 31, 2022. Search terms for each cri-
terion included individual drugs, drug classes, specific
conditions, and combinations thereof, each with a focus
on “adverse drug events” and “adverse drug reactions,”
as well as on any specific focus defined by the expert
panel. Searches targeted controlled clinical trials, obser-
vational studies, and systematic reviews and meta-
analyses, with filters for human participants, 65 years old
and older, and the English language. Clinical reviews
and guidelines were also included to provide context.
Case reports, case series, letters to the editor, and edito-
rials were excluded.

Searches identified 33,965 references; 7352 abstracts
were sent to panelists for review, of which 1574 references
were selected for full-text review. Among these, 451 manu-
scripts were abstracted into evidence tables, and an addi-
tional 148 were included as background reports.

the full panel calls, work was conducted via email. In
addition, the panel was divided into four workgroups,
each assigned a subset of the criteria, with each work-
group leading the review and synthesis of evidence for its
subset of the criteria.

®

The panel began its work using an anonymous Delphi
. Using a
process to review the 2019 AGS Beers Criteria
5-point Likert scale with anchors of “strongly disagree”
and “strongly agree,” criteria receiving three or more panel
votes of “unsure” or below were brought back for group
discussion and flagged for the individual workgroups to
review for possible updating. Of note, during the full pro-
cess, all legacy criteria were reviewed for accuracy and
appropriateness. Panelists also provided input about drugs
to be explored further for possible addition.

To guide the evidence selection, review, and synthesis
process, each workgroup reviewed and updated work-
sheets created for the 2019 criteria that identified a priori
which clinical outcomes,
indications, and comparison
groups were most relevant when considering the evi-
dence for each criterion, that is, the “desired evidence”
for reviewing each criterion. These discussions were not
considered binding but provided guidance for keeping
the evidence review and synthesis focused on what was
most clinically relevant.

Each workgroup reviewed abstracts from the litera-
ture searches for the criteria in its purview and collec-
tively selected a subset for full-text review. This selection
process considered the methodologic quality of each
study, its relevance to older adults, and its concordance
with the desired evidence noted above. After reviewing
the full text of each selected article, the workgroup then
decided by consensus which papers represented the best
available evidence, based on a balance of these same
three key considerations (methodologic quality, relevance
to older adults, and concordance with desired evidence).
Special emphasis was placed on selecting systematic
reviews and meta-analyses when available because
resource constraints precluded the panel from conducting
these types of comprehensive analyses. In general, a
study was considered relevant to older adults if the mean
or median age of participants was at least 65 years, and
especially relevant if most or all participants were older
than this age threshold.

identified markers

Papers comprising the best available evidence were
abstracted into evidence tables. These tables summarized
the design, study population, and findings of each study,
quality
and
highlighted by the GRADE criteria for clinical trials and
observational studies and by the AMSTAR criteria for
systematic reviews and meta-analyses.10–12 Each work-
group then synthesized evidence for each criterion from
the 2017–2022 literature reviews informed by GRADE

of methodologic

guidelines and the American College of Physicians' evi-
dence grading framework (Table 1).7,10

Using evidence from the 2017–2022 literature review,
findings from the previous AGS-led 2012, 2015, and 2019
updates, and clinical
judgment, each workgroup pre-
sented to the full panel their findings and suggestions for
changes (or no change) to the criteria, with ensuing dis-
cussion. For most criteria, a consensus emerged: to leave
an existing criterion from the 2019 update unchanged, to
modify it, to remove it entirely, or to add a new criterion.
Possible modifications included which drug(s) to include,
the recommendation, the rationale, the quality of evi-
dence, and the strength of the recommendation. As noted
in the GRADE guidelines, the strength of recommenda-
tion ratings incorporate a variety of considerations,
including expert opinion and clinical judgment and con-
text, and thus do not always align with the quality of evi-
dence ratings.

After proposed changes to the criteria were drafted, a
second anonymous Delphi process was used to ascertain
panel consensus on the changes, using the same 5-point
Likert scale as was previously used. As a general rule, cri-
teria receiving three or more panel votes of “unsure” or
disagreement were brought back for group discussion to
reach a consensus decision. Final edits after a public
comment period were approved through the assent of
panel members.

®

In addition to changes made based on available evi-
dence, the panel decided on several modifications to
improve the clarity and usability of
the AGS Beers
. The panel changed the order and wording of
Criteria
certain criteria, recommendations, and rationale state-
ments to improve clarity, avoid possible misinterpreta-
tions, and maintain consistency of formatting. The order
of drugs and categories listed in Table 2 was also modi-
fied for similar reasons. To enhance usability, where fea-
sible we have listed individual drugs that belong to a
specified drug class, not including agents that are rarely
or never used in the United States (as defined using the
methods described immediately below). Note that when
such drug class labels are used, the general intent is that
the criteria apply to all drugs within that class except
when specified otherwise.

To simplify and thereby increase usability, the panel
also voted to omit from key reference tables a number of
medications included in previous iterations of the criteria
that have low or zero usage in the U.S. Drugs that were
moved off the main tables due to low or absent use in the
United States are shown in Table 8. We defined low use
as <4000 U.S. Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or
older receiving the drug in 2020 based on data from
Medicare Part D Public Use Files (with the <4000 thresh-
olds representing approximately <0.01% of Medicare

the panel
decided to retain an explicit listing of certain drugs in key
reference tables despite having <4000 mentions in these
files, based on over-the-counter availability and concerns
that these drugs are still being used commonly enough to
pose a population risk, including in settings not ascer-
tainable through Medicare Part D data. Table 8 also
includes a number of PIMs that are no longer available
in the United States because there is no current manufac-
turer, they have been removed from the market, or avail-
able dosage forms limit use to specific uses outside the
scope of the criteria. These changes should not be inter-

T A B L E 1 Designations of quality of evidence and strength of recommendations.

Quality of evidence
Quality of evidence ratings for each criterion are based on a synthetic assessment of 2 complementary approaches to evaluating the quality of
evidence.

ACP-based approach7

GRADE-based approach5

High-quality
evidence

“Evidence…obtained from 1 or more well-designed and
well-executed randomized, controlled trials (RCTs)
that yield consistent and directly applicable results.
This also means that further research is very unlikely
to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.”

Moderate-quality

“Evidence…obtained from RCTs with important

Low-quality
evidence

limitations…. In addition, evidence from well-designed
controlled trials without randomization, well-designed
cohort or case–control analytic studies, and multiple
time series with or without intervention are in this
category. Moderate-quality evidence also means that
further research will probably have an important
effect on our confidence in the estimate of effect and
may change the estimate.”

“Evidence obtained from observational studies would

typically be rated as low quality because of the risk for
bias. Low-quality evidence means that further research
is very likely to have an important effect on our
confidence in the estimate of effect and will probably
change the estimate. However, the quality of evidence
may be rated as moderate or even high, depending on
circumstances under which evidence is obtained from
observational studies.”

Consider the following 5 factors for the studies that
comprise the best-available evidence for a given
criterion:

1. Risk of bias: Severity of threats to studies' internal
validity (eg, randomized vs observational design,
the potential for confounding, bias in
measurement, etc)

2. Inconsistency: Do different studies provide similar

or different estimates of effect size?

3. Indirectness: How relevant are the studies to the

clinical question at hand (eg, nature of the study of
population, comparison group, type of outcomes
measured, etc)?

4. Imprecision: Precision of estimates of effect
5. Publication bias: Risk of bias because of selective

publication of results

Overall quality of evidence that supports a given criterion: high, moderate, low.

Strength of recommendation
Strength of recommendation ratings for each criterion are based on synthetic integration of the quality of evidence, the frequency and severity
of potential adverse events and their relationship to potential benefits, and clinical judgment.

Harms, adverse events, and risks clearly outweigh the benefits.

heart failure: low
Dosage > 0.125 mg/

Use in atrial fibrillation: should not be used as a
first-line agent because there are safer and
more effective alternatives for rate control.

Use in heart failure: evidence for benefits and harms
of digoxin is conflicting and of lower quality; most
(but not all) evidence concerns use in HFrEF.
There is strong evidence for other agents as first-
line therapy to reduce hospitalizations and
mortality in adults with HFrEF. In heart failure,
higher dosages are not associated with additional
benefits and may increase the risk of toxicity. Use
caution in discontinuing digoxin among current
users with HFrEF, given limited evidence
suggesting worse clinical outcomes after
discontinuation.

Decreased renal clearance of digoxin may lead to
an increased risk of toxic effects; further dose
reduction may be necessary for those with
Stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease.

Strength of
recommendationb

Avoid antipsychotics for behavioral problems of
dementia or delirium unless documented
nonpharmacologic options (e.g., behavioral
interventions) have failed and/or the patient is
threatening substantial harm to self or others.
If used, periodic deprescribing attempts should
be considered to assess ongoing need and/or
the lowest effective dose.

High rate of physical dependence, tolerance to
sleep benefits, greater risk of overdose at low
dosages.

The use of benzodiazepines exposes users to risks
of abuse, misuse, and addiction. Concomitant
use of opioids may result in profound sedation,
respiratory depression, coma, and death.

Older adults have increased sensitivity to

benzodiazepines and decreased metabolism of
long-acting agents; the continued use of
benzodiazepines may lead to clinically
significant physical dependence. In general, all
benzodiazepines increase the risk of cognitive
impairment, delirium, falls, fractures, and
motor vehicle crashes in older adults.

May be appropriate for seizure disorders, rapid

eye movement sleep behavior disorder,
benzodiazepine withdrawal, ethanol
withdrawal, severe generalized anxiety
disorder, and periprocedural anesthesia.

Nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor
agonist hypnotics (“Z-drugs”) have adverse
events similar to those of benzodiazepines in
older adults (e.g., delirium, falls, fractures,
increased emergency room visits/
hospitalizations, motor vehicle crashes);

regimens that include only short- or rapid-
acting insulin dosed according to current blood
glucose levels without concurrent use of basal
or long-acting insulin. This recommendation
does not apply to regimens that contain basal
insulin or long-acting insulin.

Sulfonylureas have a higher risk of cardiovascular
events, all-cause mortality, and hypoglycemia
than alternative agents. Sulfonylureas may
increase the risk of cardiovascular death and
ischemic stroke.

Among sulfonylureas, long-acting agents (e.g.,

glyburide, glimepiride) confer a higher risk of
prolonged hypoglycemia than short-acting
agents (e.g., glipizide).

Avoid sulfonylureas as first- or second-line
monotherapy or add-on therapy unless
there are substantial barriers to the use
of safer and more effective agents.

If a sulfonylurea is used, choose short-

acting agents (e.g., glipizide) over long-

glimepiride).

In Table 2, the rationale for anticholinergic drugs to
avoid has been expanded to recognize the risks associated
with concurrent use (cumulative anticholinergic burden)
and is also recognized in Tables 3 and 5. The criterion for
the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovas-
cular disease has been revised and moved from the “use
with caution” table (Table 4) to Table 2, with the new
recommendation being to avoid initiating aspirin for the
primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in older
adults (in agreement with the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force's recommendation).13 For older adults who
are already taking aspirin for primary prevention, the
panel recommends deprescribing be considered, pending

changes, the supporting literature, and ramifications. The
recommendation for rivaroxaban has changed from “use
with caution” to “avoid” for long-term treatment of non-
valvular atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism
(VTE), with the rationale being that observational studies
and network meta-analyses find that this drug confers a
higher risk of major and gastrointestinal bleeding in
older adults than other direct-acting oral anticoagulants
(DOACs), particularly apixaban, but also dabigatran. The
panel recognizes there may be circumstances when rivar-
oxaban may be a reasonable choice, including for other

Warfarin: Avoid starting warfarin as initial therapy for the

(Table 2), rivaroxaban (Table 2), and dabigatran
(Table 4)—anticoagulants to avoid or to use with caution.
A “use with caution” recommendation reflects less concern

related recommendations.

treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or nonvalvular
atrial fibrillation unless alternative options (e.g., DOACs) are
contraindicated or there are substantial barriers to their use.
For older adults who have been using warfarin long-term, it
may be reasonable to continue this medication, particularly
among those with well-controlled INRs (i.e., >70% time in the
therapeutic range) and no adverse effects.

When selecting among DOACs and choosing a dosage, pay
special consideration to kidney function (see Table 6),
indication, and body weight.

Rivaroxaban: Avoid rivaroxaban for long-term treatment of
nonvalvular atrial fibrillation or VTE in favor of safer
anticoagulant alternatives.

Dabigatran: Use caution in selecting dabigatran over other

DOACs (e.g., apixaban) for long-term treatment of nonvalvular
atrial fibrillation or VTE.

Warfarin has been added to Table 2 as a medication
to be avoided when starting initial therapy for VTE or
nonvalvular
alternatives
fibrillation
(e.g., DOACs) are contraindicated or there are substantial
barriers to the use of an alternative. The distinction
between starting warfarin as initial therapy versus main-
taining warfarin among current long-term users (espe-
cially
international
normalized ratio [INR] levels) reflects different evidence
for these scenarios as well as considerations of shared
decision-making. The AGS is concerned that there are
significant barriers to the use of newer alternatives
including high out-of-pocket drug costs and formulary
restrictions. These barriers could lead to inequitable
access to DOACs that may be safer for older adults. We
urge policymakers,
insurers, and organizations in the
pharmaceutical supply chain to ensure that out-of-pocket
costs and access restrictions are not a barrier to safe and
effective anticoagulation for all of us as we age. AGS and
the expert panel recognize that cost and access will con-
tinue to be a factor in individualized decision-making
between warfarin and DOACs and among different
DOACs until payment policies are enacted that support
equitable access for all individuals regardless of their eco-
nomic and insurance status. The recommendation for
dabigatran remains as “use with caution” for the long-
term treatment of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and VTE
(Table 4) because of evidence suggesting an increased
risk of gastrointestinal and major bleeding compared
with alternatives such as apixaban.

Another change from the 2019 criteria pertains to the
initiation and continuation of estrogen in postmeno-
pausal women. The initiation of oral and transdermal
estrogen is to be avoided in older women; topical vaginal
estrogen remains appropriate for its major indications of
symptomatic vaginal atrophy or urinary tract infection
prophylaxis. Deprescribing should be considered for older
women already using nonvaginal estrogen replacement.
The recommendation for sulfonylureas has been expanded
to avoid all sulfonylureas as first- or second-line monother-
apy or add on-therapy in recognition of their association
with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, all-cause mor-
tality, and hypoglycemia than alternative choices. Here the
panel recognizes there may be substantial barriers to or
pressures opposing the recommendation, including finan-
cial ones, with similar considerations as those discussed
above for anticoagulants. If a sulfonylurea must be used,
then a short-acting agent is preferred because of the higher
risk of prolonged hypoglycemia with longer-acting

sulfonylureas (e.g., glimepiride, chlorpropramide, or glybur-
ide, which is also known as glibenclamide).

Changes to the criteria involving PIMs exacerbating
specific drug diseases and drug syndromes (Table 3) are
relatively minimal. The combination of dextromethor-
phan/quinidine was added to the list of drugs to avoid
in patients with heart failure. In the criterion of PIMs
to avoid in older adults with a history of falls or frac-
tures, the level of evidence for antidepressants has been
lowered to “moderate.” Modifications and clarifications
were made to the criteria for delirium, dementia, and
Parkinson disease, including adding opioids to the list
of drugs that can exacerbate delirium. The update con-
tinues to stress the need to avoid antipsychotics and
other medications for behavioral problems of dementia
and delirium as their use is frequently associated with
harm and increased during and after pandemic
lockdowns.14–16 The use of behavioral
interventions
and search for modifiable triggers for behavior14,17
remains the preferred management strategy and should
be clearly documented in the health record. The use of
antipsychotics and other medications listed in these cri-
teria should be a last resort in collaboration and with
the use of shared decision-making with older adults

As mentioned above, the criteria for aspirin and rivar-
oxaban have been moved from Table 4 to Table 2. Tica-
grelor has been added to the criterion about prasugrel,
advising that it be used with caution, particularly among
adults 75 years old and older because of concerns of
major bleeding. A new criterion was added advising that
sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors be
used with caution because of the increased risk of uro-
genital infection and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis,
and recommends monitoring early during treatment. Of
note, the panel recognizes the value of SGLT2-inhibitors
but also wishes to emphasize that patients taking these
drugs should be monitored actively for possible adverse
effects.

The panel worked to clarify and consolidate the clini-
cally important drug–drug interactions (Table 5), most
notably the use of multiple agents with anticholinergic
activity, the concurrent use of ≥3 CNS-active drugs from
specific therapeutic categories (which now include skele-
tal muscle relaxants), and the addition of SSRIs to the list
of warfarin drug–drug interactions.

the older person's preferences and goals of care. As in
previous updates to the AGS Beers Criteria
, the panel
has included caveats about when choosing a PIM may be
reasonable, for example, a benzodiazepine for alcohol
withdrawal.

®

The panel also deliberated about and recognizes that
clinicians and older adults may face substantial financial
pressures to use PIMs—such as when a safer treatment
option incurs substantially higher out-of-pocket costs—
and that drug affordability is an important consideration

aData on whether certain bladder antimuscarinics confer greater
adverse cognitive effects than others lack consistent quality.
Oxybutynin has the best evidence for adverse cognitive effects.
However, caution is warranted for all bladder antimuscarinics
given their potential anticholinergic effects.20

for many older adults and their caregivers. In general,
the panel did not account for drug costs to different
stakeholders when making decisions about which PIMs
to include in the criteria. However, costs of care may play
an important role in shared decision-making, and the
panel strongly encourages policymakers and health plans
to ensure that safer alternatives to PIMs are affordable so
that access to safe, appropriate treatment is not limited
and inequities are not exacerbated. In addition to drug
costs, costs of avoidable drug-related harms should be
considered as well.

While most of the criteria (i.e., those listed in Tables 2,
3, 5, and 6) generally use the “avoid” recommendation
noted above, Table 4 comprises drugs to “use with cau-
tion.” The intent of this “use with caution” table is to high-
light drugs that raise some cause for concern but not to the
level of an “avoid” recommendation. This can occur
because the evidence for the concern is limited or lacks
consistency, the degree of harm relative to alternative ther-
apies is not high enough to warrant an “avoid” recommen-
dation, or extenuating clinical circumstances are often
present. The panel encourages clinicians to recognize the
potential harms of these medications and, as the moniker
states, to use them with caution. We also remind readers
due to
that drugs removed from the AGS Beers Criteria
low usage or unavailability in the United States (Table 8)
are still considered potentially inappropriate per recom-
mendations of the 2019 AGS Beers Criteria

update.

®

®

Unless specified otherwise, the criteria are designed
to apply to adults 65 years old and older. The panel recog-
nizes that drug-related harms are typically more pro-
nounced in the “old-old” than in the “young-old” and in
persons with complex multimorbidity and frailty. Thus,
two older adults of the same age can have markedly dif-
ferent risks of drug-related harm. Certain criteria include
a specific age cutoff; these are provided when the evi-
dence is specific to that age group. However, for most cri-
teria, the evidence base is insufficient to set a specific age
threshold for applying the criteria or to set a threshold
for other factors that can increase the risk of medication-
related harms (e.g., functional and cognitive status, the
burden of multimorbidity, and polypharmacy). We
encourage clinicians to use common sense in applying
the criteria in clinical practice.

For some criteria, the panel distinguished between initi-
ating a medication versus continuing one already in long-
standing use. Such distinctions were considered by the
panel in cases when the evidence suggested differential risk
of harm in these two scenarios, when the evidence primar-
ily addressed initiation rather than a continuation, and/or
when other professional society recommendations made
this distinction. In a number of these criteria, the criteria
recommend avoiding initiating the drug in nonusers and
considering deprescribing among current users.

advanced age, cognitive and physical impairment, multi-
morbid burden, frailty, renal impairment, and a high
degree of polypharmacy each conferring risk. A person's
underlying risk of experiencing drug-related harms
should inform decisions about using drugs in the criteria.
Second, close attention to the recommendations is essen-
tial to avoid misinterpretation; many criteria note excep-
tions and other considerations and should not be overly
simplified as “avoid in everyone over age 65.” Third, the
risk of harm arises not just from drugs considered in isola-
tion but from how multiple drugs affect an older adult
when given together. Thus, evaluations of medication
appropriateness should be made in the context of the total-
ity of a person's medication regimen and their goals of care.

ply telling an older person to stop taking a medication.
Communication gaps and misunderstandings, patient
reluctance and fear of stopping, coordination among mul-
tiple clinicians, dosage tapering, withdrawal symptoms,
and conveying stop orders to pharmacies are just some of
the challenges that can arise. The panel encourages clini-
cians to be aware of and develop skills to address these
challenges. Useful resources include:

• https://deprescribing.org/resources/—deprescribing

resources, especially evidence-based guidelines and
easy-to-use algorithms about when and how to stop

Systemic solutions are essential as well, for example
increasing the adoption of the CancelRx Script Standard
to communicate to pharmacies when a drug is stopped
and should no longer be refilled.

Strengths and limitations

®

As with previous versions of the AGS Beers Criteria
, this
update is subject to the same limitations. First, the evi-
dence available is often plagued by the small number of
clinical trials in older adults or by the lack of inclusion of
a sufficient number of older adults to conduct an age-
specific analysis. The panel often relied on observational
studies and meta-analyses for evidence of harm and
whether the harm was more common or resulted in more
serious outcomes in older adults.

affected,

disproportionately

Second, the lack of diversity in study populations was
another challenge to the panel. Inadequate enrollment of
and
underrepresented,
understudied populations in clinical trials is a distress-
ingly well-described phenomenon. In the evidence the
panel reviewed, a seemingly larger number of studies
identified were generated within a specific country, pos-
sibly contributing to greater racial and ethnic homogene-
ity among study participants. Even when more diverse
populations were included in a study, there was often
inadequate power to determine outcomes by specific
groups. Third,
the criteria include only medications
available in the United States. Clinicians outside the
United States, with access to different medications from
the same drug class as those the criteria recommends
avoiding, will need to adapt the criteria to their local con-
text. Fourth, it is possible that our literature search did
not identify all published evidence that would have been
pertinent. Our search strategy did not include unpub-
lished studies, papers not published in English, white
papers, abstracts, technical reports, or other evidence
published in the “gray literature.”

Despite its limitations, the 2023 AGS Beers Criteria
has its strengths. The panel and staff are highly experi-
enced; most have participated in updating the criteria
since 2012, and some since 2003. Their familiarity with
the process and modified Delphi technique is an advan-
tage. The panel also included ad hoc members from
important stakeholders, namely the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid, the National Committee for Quality Assur-
ance, and the Pharmacy Quality Alliance, who provided
valuable insight and feedback throughout the process.
Robust internal review and external public comment pro-
cesses are additional strengths.
