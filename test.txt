High risk of adverse CNS effects; may cause bradycardia
and orthostatic hypotension; not recommended as routine
treatment for hypertension

Avoid other CNS alpha-agonists as
listed

Quality of
Evidence

Strength of
Recommendation

Low

Strong

Clonidine for ﬁrst-line treatment
of hypertension
Other CNS alpha-agonists

Guanabenz
Guanfacine
Methyldopa
Reserpine (>0.1 mg/day)

Disopyramide

Dronedarone

Digoxin for ﬁrst-line treatment of atrial
ﬁbrillation or of heart failure

Nifedipine, immediate release

Amiodarone

Central nervous system

Antidepressants, alone or in combination

Amitriptyline
Amoxapine
Clomipramine
Desipramine
Doxepin >6 mg/day
Imipramine

May induce heart failure in older adults because of potent
negative inotropic action; strongly anticholinergic; other
antiarrhythmic drugs preferred
Worse outcomes have been reported in patients taking
dronedarone who have permanent atrial ﬁbrillation or
severe or recently decompensated heart failure.
Use in atrial ﬁbrillation: should not be used as a ﬁrst-line
agent in atrial ﬁbrillation, because there are safer and
more effective alternatives for rate control supported by
high-quality evidence.
Use in heart failure: evidence for beneﬁts and harms of
digoxin is conﬂicting and of lower quality; most but not all
of the evidence concerns use in HFrEF. There is strong
evidence for other agents as ﬁrst-line therapy to reduce
hospitalizations and mortality in adults with HFrEF. In
heart failure, higher dosages are not associated with
additional beneﬁt and may increase risk of toxicity.
Decreased renal clearance of digoxin may lead to
increased risk of toxic effects; further dose reduction may
be necessary in those with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney
disease.
Potential for hypotension; risk of precipitating myocardial
ischemia
Effective for maintaining sinus rhythm but has greater
toxicities than other antiarrhythmics used in atrial
ﬁbrillation; may be reasonable ﬁrst-line therapy in patients
with concomitant heart failure or substantial left
ventricular hypertrophy if rhythm control is preferred over
rate control

Avoid

Avoid in individuals with permanent
atrial ﬁbrillation or severe or recently
decompensated heart failure
Avoid this rate control agent as ﬁrst-
line therapy for atrial ﬁbrillation
Avoid as ﬁrst-line therapy for heart
failure
If used for atrial ﬁbrillation or heart

Rationale

Recommendation

Potential for cardiac problems; contraindicated in men
with prostate cancer

Avoid unless indicated for conﬁrmed
hypogonadism with clinical symptoms

Quality of
Evidence

Strength of
Recommendation

Moderate

Weak

Androgens

Methyltestosterone
Testosterone
Desiccated thyroid

Estrogens with or without progestins

Growth hormone

Insulin, sliding scale (insulin regimens
containing only short- or rapid-acting insulin
dosed according to current blood glucose
levels without concurrent use of basal or
long-acting insulin)

Megestrol

Sulfonylureas, long acting

Chlorpropamide
Glimepiride
Glyburide (also known as glibenclamide)

Gastrointestinal

Metoclopramide

Mineral oil, given orally

Proton-pump inhibitors

Concerns about cardiac effects; safer alternatives
available
Evidence of carcinogenic potential (breast and
endometrium); lack of cardioprotective effect and
cognitive protection in older women
Evidence indicates that vaginal estrogens for the treatment
of vaginal dryness are safe and effective; women with a
history of breast cancer who do not respond to
nonhormonal therapies are advised to discuss the risks and
beneﬁts of low-dose vaginal estrogen (dosages of estradiol
<25 μg twice weekly) with their healthcare provider
Impact on body composition is small and associated with
edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome,
gynecomastia, impaired fasting glucose

Higher risk of hypoglycemia without improvement in
hyperglycemia management regardless of care setting.
Avoid insulin regimens that include only short- or rapid-
acting insulin dosed according to current blood glucose
levels without concurrent use of basal or long-acting
insulin. This recommendation does not apply to regimens
that contain basal insulin or long-acting insulin.
Minimal effect on weight; increases risk of thrombotic
events and possibly death in older adults
Chlorpropamide: prolonged half-life in older adults; can
cause prolonged hypoglycemia; causes SIADH
Glimepiride and glyburide: higher risk of severe
prolonged hypoglycemia in older adults

Can cause extrapyramidal effects, including tardive
dyskinesia; risk may be greater in frail older adults and
with prolonged exposure
Potential for aspiration and adverse effects; safer
alternatives available
Risk of Clostridium difﬁcile infection and bone loss and
fractures

gastrointestinal ulcers, gross bleeding, or perforation
caused by NSAIDs occur in ~1% of patients treated for
3-6 months and in ~2%-4% of patients treated for 1 year;

with dementia.
May cause ataxia, impaired psychomotor
function, syncope, additional falls; shorter-
acting benzodiazepines are not safer than
long-acting ones.

If one of the drugs must be used, consider
reducing use of other CNS-active
medications that increase risk of falls and
fractures (ie, antiepileptics, opioid-receptor
agonists, antipsychotics, antidepressants,
nonbenzodiazepine and benzodiazepine
receptor agonist hypnotics, other
sedatives/hypnotics) and implement other
strategies to reduce fall risk. Data for
antidepressants are mixed but no compelling
evidence that certain antidepressants confer
less fall risk than others.
Dopamine-receptor antagonists with
potential to worsen parkinsonian symptoms

Exceptions:
Pimavanserin and clozapine appear to
be less likely to precipitate worsening
of Parkinson disease. Quetiapine has

Rationale

Recommendation

Quality of
Evidence

Strength of
Recommendation

Aspirin for primary prevention
of cardiovascular disease
and colorectal cancer

Dabigatran
Rivaroxaban

Prasugrel

Antipsychotics
Carbamazepine
Diuretics
Mirtazapine
Oxcarbazepine
SNRIs
SSRIs
TCAs
Tramadol
Dextromethorphan/
quinidine

Trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole

Risk of major bleeding from aspirin
increases markedly in older age. Several
studies suggest lack of net beneﬁt when
used for primary prevention in older adult
with cardiovascular risk factors, but evidence
is not conclusive. Aspirin is generally
indicated for secondary prevention in older
adults with established cardiovascular
disease.
Increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding
compared with warfarin and reported rates
with other direct oral anticoagulants when
used for long-term treatment of VTE or atrial
ﬁbrillation in adults ≥75 years.
Increased risk of bleeding in older adults;
beneﬁt in highest-risk older adults (eg, those
with prior myocardial infarction or diabetes
mellitus) may offset risk when used for its
approved indication of acute coronary
syndrome to be managed with percutaneous
coronary intervention.
May exacerbate or cause SIADH or
hyponatremia; monitor sodium level closely
when starting or changing dosages in older
adults

Use with caution in
adults ≥70 years

Moderate

Limited efﬁcacy in patients with behavioral
symptoms of dementia (does not apply to
treatment of PBA). May increase risk of falls
and concerns with clinically signiﬁcant drug
interactions. Does not apply to treatment of
pseudobulbar affect.
Increased risk of hyperkalemia when used
concurrently with an ACEI or ARB in
presence of decreased creatinine clearance

Use with caution

Moderate

Strong

Low

Strong

Use with caution in
patients on ACEI
or ARB and
decreased
creatinine
clearance

Abbreviations: ACEI, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; PBA, pseudobulbar affect; SIADH, syndrome of inappro-
priate antidiuretic hormone secretion; SNRI, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA, tricyclic antide-
pressant; VTE, venous thromboembolism.
aThe primary target audience is the practicing clinician. The intentions of the criteria include (1) improving the selection of prescription drugs by clinicians
and patients; (2) evaluating patterns of drug use within populations; (3) educating clinicians and patients on proper drug usage; and (4) evaluating health-
outcome, quality-of-care, cost, and utilization data.

DISCUSSION

®

The 2019 AGS Beers Criteria
update contributes to the
critically important evidence base and discussion of medica-
tions to avoid in older adults and the need to improve medi-
®
cation use in older adults. The 2019 AGS Beers Criteria
include 30 individual criteria of medications or medication
classes to be avoided in older adults (Table 2) and 16 cri-
teria speciﬁc to more than 40 medications or medication
classes that should be used with caution or avoided in cer-
tain diseases or conditions (Tables 3 and 4). As in past

updates, there were several changes to the 2019 AGS Beers
®
, including criteria that were modiﬁed or dropped,
Criteria
a few new criteria, and some changes in the level of evi-
dence grading and clariﬁcations in language and rationale
(Tables 8–10).

The 2019 AGS Beers Criteria

is the third such update
®
by the AGS and the ﬁfth update of the AGS Beers Criteria
since their original release.1,2,10–12 The criteria was ﬁrst
published almost 30 years ago in 1991, making them the
longest running criteria for PIMs in older adults.

relative increase in opioids occurred in persons 55 to
64 (754% increase from 0.2% to 1.7%) and 65 years and
older and the absolute number of deaths in this group is
moderate.21,22

Several drug-drug interactions involving antimicrobial
agents were also added to Table 5, and the recommendation
three or more CNS-active
to avoid concurrent use of

medications was reformatted to clarify and bring further
attention to the increased risk of falls and other harms that
can occur when multiple CNS-active medications are
combined.23

PIM use continues to be a serious problem in older
adults and especially in vulnerable older adults with multi-
ple chronic conditions. Thus, the AGS Beers Criteria
con-
tinue to be useful and necessary as a clinical tool, as an
educational tool at the bedside, and as a public health tool
to improve medication safety in older adults. The AGS
can increase awareness of polypharmacy
Beers Criteria
and aid decision making when choosing drugs to avoid in
older adults. In a 2017 study using medical expenditure
data (n = 16,588) in adults 65 years and older, poor health
status was associated with increased PIM use. In another
study, the use of PIMs, as measured by the 2015 criteria, in
persons with dementia was 11% higher after diagnosis than
in the year of diagnosis.24,25 Benzodiazepine use remains
common in older adults, especially in older women, despite
the fact that older adults are highly vulnerable to harms
these drugs.26 The challenge of
associated with use of
decreasing PIM use and improving the overall quality of
medication prescribing in older adults remains, and the
AGS Beers Criteria

are one part of the solution.

®

The AGS Beers Criteria

are an essential evidence-
based tool that should be used as a guide for drugs to avoid
in older adults. However, they are not meant to supplant
judgment or an individual patient’s preferences,
clinical
values, care goals, and needs, nor should they be used puni-
tively or to excessively restrict access to medications. These
criteria were developed to be used in conjunction with a
person-centered team approach (physicians, nurses, phar-
macists, other clinicians, the older adult, family, and others)
to prescribing and monitoring adverse effects.27 A compan-
ion article published to the 2015 updated AGS Beers
®
, entitled “How to Use the Beers Criteria: A Guide
Criteria
for Patients, Clinicians, Health Systems, and Payors,”
remains an important guide for using the AGS Beers
. It reminds clinicians that medications listed in the
Criteria
Criteria are potentially inappropriate, rather than deﬁnitely
inappropriate for all older adults, and encourages users to
read the rationale and recommendation statements for each
medication to avoid because these statements provide
important guidance.3 Moreover, the criteria should not be
interpreted as giving license to steer patients away from
PIMs to even worse choices. For example, the recommenda-
tion to avoid chronic, regular use of NSAIDs should not be
